# STGCN Simulation
PyTorch simulation of the spatio-temporal graph convolutional network proposed in [Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks: A Deep Learning Framework for Traffic Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04875) by Bing Yu, Haoteng Yin, Zhanxing Zhu.

The `pytorch` implementation is modified from [STGCN-PyTorch](https://github.com/FelixOpolka/STGCN-PyTorch).

The traffic data source is obtained from http://pems.dot.ca.gov/.
